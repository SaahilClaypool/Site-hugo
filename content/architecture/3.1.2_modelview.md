    - process
        - Non functional requirements
        - performance
        - availability
        - sequence diagram: order
    - development
        - details like programming languages
        - project management
    - physical
        - Map to hardware
        - UML Deployment diagram
    - (scenerios)
        - Use cases & user tasks
        - Show how different views work together
        - Script to show how different parts interact with each other.

- component diagram
    - High level, doesn't include the how
        - E.g. just ingredients for the pizza
      - static view w/o interaction
      - ball connector: shows provided interface
