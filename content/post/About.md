<img src="/img/HeadShot.jpg" alt="Me" style="width: 200px;"/>

I am a computer science major currently studying at Worcester Polytechnic Institute (WPI) class of 2019. 
I live in Acton, Massachusetts and graduated from the Acton-Boxborough Regional High School in 2015. 

In my free time I play a lot of soccer; I played Varsity soccer in High School and was the Captain my senior year. I played one year of college. I also play a number of video games and card games including League of Legends, FIFA, and the card game Nertz (I would highly recommend learning Nertz).


I am interested in all areas of computer science, from programming language theory to network protocols. I do have a specific interest in bioinformatics and data science.
