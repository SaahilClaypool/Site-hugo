This site is built with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/quick-start/)

Hugo is a static site generator that converts markdown into webpages using templates.
Tutorials ofte push a theme providing pre-configured css and directory layouts, but I have found that building templates from scratch provide much more control over the site.

If you're interested in learning more, or you're me and forgot how to do this, see the posts below on how to configure a hugo site from scratch.
